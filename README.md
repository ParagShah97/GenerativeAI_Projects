# Generative AI Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of **mini Generative AI projects** that explore different use cases across retrieval, summarization, automation, and intelligent assistants.  
Each project focuses on applying **LLMs, RAG pipelines, and AI agents** to solve practical problems.  
More projects and improvements will continue to be added over time.

## Project Overview

### Hybrid_Search
Implements hybrid retrieval combining **semantic embeddings** and **keyword search** for more accurate document and query results.

### Project_to_connect_ollama
Demonstrates integration with **Ollama** â€” running and querying local LLMs for low-latency, privacy-preserving inference.

### auto-complete
AI-assisted **text completion system** that provides context-aware code or content suggestions using transformer-based models.

### chatbot-langgraph
A **LangGraph-powered conversational agent**, designed with modular tool-calling and memory management for multi-turn dialogues.

### chatbot_sql_RAG
Implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** chatbot that interacts with SQL databases to answer data-driven queries.

### github_readme_BE
Backend service that analyzes GitHub repositories using LLMs to **generate structured README files and project summaries**.

### local_ai_agent
An **offline AI agent** capable of running on local hardware, integrating lightweight LLMs for private, self-contained reasoning.

### pdf_qa
A **PDF Question-Answering app** that indexes and queries documents using embeddings and vector search for semantic understanding.
